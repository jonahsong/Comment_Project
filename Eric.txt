Eric Lian: 

	 In Computer Science I: Python Language, we covered an introduction to the Python programming language. We learned how to utilize strings, variables, lists, for loops, the range function, if-then statements, logical operators, Boolean variables, imports, packages, functions, dicitonaries, loop exits, while loops, and tuples. For each of our six units, we spent one week learning and practicing the skills of that unit in an assignment, followed by another week to complete a problem qset in which we apply and synthesize the unit's skills at a higher level. Each unit concluded with a test at the end of the problem set week.

	 So far, Eric has shown that he is uninterested in the course and does not want to put in the work. He must work harder in order to salvage his grade. Eric struggled to collaborate with his classmates. From the 2 group assignments that we did this semester——the Bank Project and the Hackaton——, Eric had a project average of 72.5. Eric persevered throughout the course, demonstrated by test improvement. His test average improved from 66.25 in the first quarter to 77.5 in the second quarter. Eric has come to find help occasionally, but should probably come more often.

	 Eric has not performed very well on in-class exams; he has mostly received D's on tests, including a 70.5% on the final. With a test average of 69.3, I urge Eric to come get extra help outside of class. I am always free to answer questions during office hours or after school and I think that more practice would benefit Eric a lot. I think Eric should not get discouraged. With more hard work in the second semester, he will have a lot of opportunity for improvement.

	 This elective course does not necessarily come easily to everyone, and Eric struggled a lot with the material. He earns a D+ for the semester, and I wish him luck for the rest of the year.
