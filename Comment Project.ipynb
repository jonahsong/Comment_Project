Of course, if he ever has any questions or needs any help, he should not hestitate to come by during office hours or after school. But Hugh is clearly a talented computer scientist who independently solves problems very well. Hugh is doing excellent work in this course with ease. However, he completes the assignments and problem early and often has a lot of spare time during our work periods. Because he has so much unused time during class periods, I would encourage him to explore Java, another programming language. The AP Computer Science Test is actually in Java and I think that Hugh would do very well. I could also work with Hugh to think of more extension projects to do.\n",
